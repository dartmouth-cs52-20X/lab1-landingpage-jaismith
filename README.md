# Scanner CLI Landing Page

This site is a clone of [surge.sh](https://surge.sh). I copied the basic stylistic elements, as well as fonts and colors, and generalized it for use with my own content. This demo site is about a timetable scanner CLI I worked on in freshman year, which felt appropriate since the actual surge site is advertising a CLI as well!

## What Worked Well

CSS variables, flexbox, and font integration worked fantastically. The naming conventions I used for classes, and the general organization of my html/css made it very easy to work with and pretty much bug-free on the first attempt.

## What Didn't

Something is inexplicably occupying space at the bottom of the tools section, and I can't quite figure out what is causing it. There is no padding in any of the elements, and it disappears on mobile, but looks pretty ugly on the desktop version.
